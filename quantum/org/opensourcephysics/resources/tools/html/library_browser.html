    <h1>Open Source Physics Digital Library Browser</h1>
<p>The OSP Digital Library Browser enables you to browse, organize and access collections of digital library resources such as EJS models and Tracker experiments. Collections and resources may be on a local drive or remote server.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open a collection by choosing from the <strong>Collections</strong> menu or entering a URL directly in the toolbar as with a web browser. </li>
      <li>Collections are organized and displayed in a tree. Each tree node is a resource or sub-collection. Click a node to learn about the resource or double-click to download and/or open it in EJS or Tracker.</li>
      <li>Build and organize your own local collection by clicking the <strong>Open Editor</strong> button. Collections are stored as xml documents that contain references to the actual resource files. For more information, see the Help menu.</li>
      <li>Share your collections by uploading all files to the web or a local network. For more information, see the Help menu.</li>
    </ul>
